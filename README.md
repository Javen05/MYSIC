## Context:  
 The app concept was designed using Adobe XD Software.
 Then, it was coded out with Java using Android Studio as IDE.
 The Android App was intended to resemble the Adobe XD App.

## Reflection:
 With no prior experience to app designing or using music apps like Spotify,   
 My app concept was my purest idea for a Music Player App.

 MYSIC went through many versions as it was relentlessly refined throughout  
 10+ Usability Testers, stretched over the course of ~2 months.  

 Java and Android Studio had been an unpleasaning mix in general, especially when it is my first programming language.  
 It took me an intensive month to build the App.   
 Unfortunately, I was unable to recreate the complete concept of MYSIC as an Android App.
