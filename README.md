## Context:  
### The app concept was designed using Adobe XD Software.
### Then, it was coded out with Java using Android Studio as IDE.
### The Android App was intended to resemble the Adobe XD App.

## Reflection:  
### With no prior experience to app designing or using music apps like Spotify,   
### My app concept was my purest idea for a Music Player App.

### MYSIC went through many versions as it was relentlessly refined throughout  
### 10+ Usability Testers, stretched over the course of ~2 months.  

### Java and Android Studio had been an unpleasaning mix in general, especially when it is my first programming language.  
### It took me an intensive month to build the App.   
### Unfortunately, I was unable to recreate the complete concept of MYSIC as an Android App.
